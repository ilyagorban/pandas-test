You can launch 3 services:
- bamboo-app (basic original nodejs service, fixed initializer of dispatcher class)
- gify-panda-app (service of random picture of pandas)
- counter-panda-app (service of counting post requests)

To enable launching of any of the services (all three or some subset of them):
- you need to add relevant task with its roles from base.yml

Testing of services implemented in python, and the testing is launched via Ansible tasks.

Reload /Enable / Disable of services can be done with command 'vagrant reload --provision'
Notes:
- gify-panda and counter panda are working standalone, but it does not work when running from vagrant. I've stopped with solution as it started to take too much time (more than 2 hour). As solution could be:
    - correct configuration of apache + wsgi
- Also I found that both services are not running side-by-side. As solution could be the following:
    - changing ports for each of the services in Vagrant file
    - implementation of modularity of the services + main service that will run enabled services.
