You can launch 3 services:
- bamboo-app (basic original nodejs service, fixed initializer of dispatcher class)
- gify-panda-app (service of random picture of pandas)
- counter-panda-app (service of counting post requests)

To enable launching of any of the services (all three or some subset of them):
- you need to add relevant task with its roles from automatic_deploy_base.yml

Testing of services implemented in python, and the testing is launched via Ansible tasks.

Reload /Enable / Disable of services will be actually done with command 'vagrant reload --provision' once vagrant 'base' machine is on.
